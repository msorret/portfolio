        From September of 2017 to August of 2018, I worked as a UX/UI intern for
        the Human Factors Engineering Department of the U.S. Department of
        Veteran Affairs. I worked with the departments UX Designer, primarily on
        developing a UX guide and conducting usability walkthroughs on mobile
        products.

        <br /><br />
        The UX guide covered guidelines for other departments to follow, on
        building personas, user journeys, and principles of UX design.
        <br /><br />
        The major product that I worked on was an internal application for
        mental health professionals to streamline the process of admitting a
        patient. For this project, I recorded data during usability walkthroughs
        of the original design, organized and analyzed the data, and developed
        slide decks to present findings and suggestions.
