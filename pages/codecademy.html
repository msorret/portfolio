    <p class="section-title">My Role</p>
    <p class="section-body">
        In May of 2022, I was hired by Codecademy as a freelance Content
        Contributor, to assist in the development of their new UX & UI design
        courses. Over the course of a year and a half, I worked on three
        production cycles, developing content for the courses Learn User
        Research: Generative, Learn Interaction Design, and Learn Visual Design.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this role, I wrote lessons, learning standards, projects, quizzes,
        and practice content based on objectives and a course plan designed by
        the Lead Curriculum Designer. I also designed and prototypes a number of
        applets, working with the applet developer to produce them for specific
        lessons. All content items went through a minimum of 2 rounds of review,
        by both the Lead Curriculum Designer and the team's Subject Matter
        Expert. <br />
        <br />
        During these productions, I spent 10-15 hours a week developing the
        content, in addition to my full time teaching position.

        Beginner Course: Learn User Research: Generative
        </p>
        <p class="section-body" style="width: 936px">
        For this production, I developed two articles and one project:
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-user-research-generative/articles/ui-and-ux-how-to-conduct-user-interviews">How to Conduct User Interviews</a>,
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-user-research-generative/articles/ui-and-ux-how-to-analyze-qualitative-data">How to Analyze Qualitative Data</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-user-research-generative/projects/ui-and-ux-connect-best-user-interview">Connect Best: User Interview</a>. These content items fit
        into the total course based on the syllabus below.

        <br> <p class="section-body">
        The articles covered how to conduct effective user interviews and how to
        analyze the data from those user interviews. For the article How to
        Conduct User Interviews, I also designed a simple applet to allow users
        to practice running a mock interview. I built a high-fidelity prototype
        in Figma worked with an in-house applet developer to develop the applet
        in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    <p class="section-body">The project prompted users to use what they learned to conduct user interviews based on the following problem statement:
        <br><br>
        In the United States, adults report that it is difficult to meet people who share
        similar hobbies and interests. They want to befriend like-minded people, but they don't
        know where to start. Additionally, it can be difficult to maintain friendships with people they don't see on a regular basis. This problem is important because they want to enjoy good company in their free time.
        <br><br>
        In this project, users had to:
        <br>
        <ul class="section-body">
        <li>Develop a Research Plan</li>
        <li> Prepare an Interview Discussion Guide</li>

        <li>Analyze Data using an Affinity Map</li>

            For this production, I developed the Information Architecture and Navigation module, which included the

            The lesson covered the basic principles of information architecture and navigation, including how to run content audits and develop a site map. The quiz tested users on the concepts and skills covered in the lesson.
            <br> <br>
            The project prompted users to use what they learned to run a content audit and develop a site map for the following problem statement.
            <br> <br> 
            You and your team have just received a generous grant to find solutions for humanitarian issues in your community by a group of donors. The donors are primarily focused on addressing food insecurity, defined as a lack of consistent access to enough food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy life. More than 34 million people experience food insecurity in the United States.
            <br> <br> 
            You have been tasked to design and develop a new website to spread awareness or address food insecurity in some way. The first step of your goal is to design and present the information architecture.
            <br> <br> 
            In this project, users had to:

                The lesson covered basic color theory, color harmony, semantic color, and color & accessibility. For this lesson, I designed two versions of basic website prototype for a restaurant - one that users the principles of color in visual design effectively and one that does not.

                The quiz tested users on the concepts and skills covered in the lesson. The article acted as a written tutorial on how to build color palettes and color tools in Figma.
                <br><br>
                The project prompted users to use what they learned to inspiration board, color scheme, color palette, and apply their color choices to mid-fidelity prototypes. They were given the following problem statement:
                <br><br>
                After completing the initial layouts for up-and-coming electro-pop band Upward Spiral's website, you are tasked with creating a color scheme that represents the band's music, style, and message.

                <li>Develop a color scheme to define primary, secondary, and accent colors</li>

                        Due to taking on new responsibilities in my teaching position, I was unable to take on any new productions in the 2023-24 academic year. I loved working with this team to develop these courses and was really sad to go. I learned so much about visual design and UX/UI design and research through writing the lessons and completing the project solutions - it felt like I was taking courses myself! The entire experience was amazing and I cannot recommend this team or company enough.
