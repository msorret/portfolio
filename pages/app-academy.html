        <p class = "section-title"> Data Driven Design Model </p>
        <p class = "section-body"> I want the curriculum I build to be designed with the students in my classroom in mind. I am constantly surveying and pulling data to make sure that projects, assessments, units, and overall courses are working effectively.    </p>
        

        <div class = "side-by-side">
            <div> <img class = "sbs-left" src = "/assets/course-data.png" style = "width: 433px; height: 703px;"></img></div>
            <div class = "sbs-right" style ="padding-left: 5%"> <p style ="margin-top: 0"> After each project and assessment, students complete a short survey to find out how difficult they found the assignment, how much they enjoyed it, how much time it took, and how prepared they felt to complete it. </p> <br>
              <p>This data allows me to adjust in real time. If a significant portion of my students felt unprepared or did not enjoy a project, I can adjust the course schedule, go back and reteach certain topics, or develop the next project in a different style/subject.</p><br>
               <p> This data also allows me to work effectively with my team - the other teachers implementing this curriculum. We meet regularly to discuss these data points and make changes to the curriculum or instructional design/resources.</p><br>
               <p> This survey data is especially useful when used in combination with student grades and performance data. These surveys allowed me to get  insight into why a student may not be performing well in the class. These surveys allowed me to get  insight into why a student may not be performing well in the class or identify students who need to be challenged more.  </p></div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p class = "section-body"> All students in the App Academy are also surveyed at the end of the first month, the first semester, and the end of the year. In these surveys, I learn a lot more about student's thoughts and feelings about the class and program overall. Their answers help me adjust the overall design of the course. I learn about topics they wished we spent more time on, topics they wished we spent less, times of the year they were more or less productive, topics they wish we had covered. </p><br>
        
        <p class = "section-body"><br>
            And I use a lot of their suggestions! For example, in the 2022-23 academic year, the sophomore course was just a web development course. In a student survey at the end of the semester,  a student expressed he wished that we had covered principles of UX design, research, and the development process in other contexts, such as game development. His response was so compelling that I refactored the second semester curriculum to split between web and game development. This year, that change has remained and become a permanent part of the course pathway. </p>

    <div class = "section">

        <p class = "section-title"> Interdisciplinary Design </p>
        <p class = "section-body"> Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background, I knew I wanted to create a curriculum that was diverse in it's design and catered to students with all sorts of different interests and goals. </p>
        <p class = "section-body"> To help students explore their interests and connect with other like-minded students, I created the marble class system. 
        </p>
        <p class = "section-body"> The marble classes are modeled after the Harry Potter houses. But instead of personality traits, they are based off of intersections of technology and other fields. The marble classes named after four notable people in the intersection of technology. Students are sorted into one of the four classes based on their own interests in technology. </p>
        
        <img src = "/assets/marble-classes.png" style = "width: 750px; display: flex; margin: auto; justify-content: center;">
        <br>
        <p class = "section-body"> Students complete projects, class activities, and games within their marble classes. Through these activities, they can also earn marbles for their class. When a marble class earns 200 marbles, they throw a marble party at lunch - inviting members of the class across all four grades. This has been a great way for the students to build relationships in other grades, meet students with similar interests, and expand on class projects in ways that are meaningful to them. 
        </p><br>
        <p class = "section-body"> I tested this idea with my own classes in the 2022-23 academic year, then expanded it to the entire program in the 2023-24 - making adjustments based on student feedback. Over the summer of 2023, I also redecorated four classrooms to make common rooms & project spaces for the four marble classes. I've also organized marble themed events such as a hackathon, computer science olympics, encryption escape rooms, and field trips to tech companies, museums, and college campuses.</p>

        <p class = "section-title"> Partners & Certificate Programs</p>
        <p class = "section-body"> To create a more hands-on, career focused experience, I have partnered with a number of businesses and universities to create student experiences and certificate programs to help students explore career and educational opportunities outside of the classroom. </p>
        <p class = "section-body"> Most notably, we have worked with Spotify, Netflix, Cal Tech, and the Art Center School of Design to host tours, guest speaker workshops, and networking events for our students.</p>
        <img src = "/assets/spotify.JPG" style = "width: 870px;">

        <p class = "section-body"> Students also had the opportunity to take a UX Certificate program, taught by Art Center Interaction Design faculty in our classroom. In addition, many students participate in a summer research program at Cal Tech, through the academy internship program. </p>
        <p class="section-body"> In my role, I work with existing partners to create, plan, and execute these student experiences - working on the school side logistics from the date and time, transportation, budget, district approval, and curriculum integration. In addition, I reach out to and meet with new potential partners, as we are always looking to expand our students experience.</p>

        <p class = "section-title"> Fun Fridays</p>
        <p class = "section-body"> Fun Fridays was an idea I started my first year, as a way for students to take a bi-monthly mental health break and bond with their classmates. Every other week, students participate in Fun Friday - an off screen class period where we'll play games, do class activities, make art, or go out to the field to play sports. I design many of these class activities and games myself - some for Fun Fridays, some for class reviews, and some to act as class bonding activities.  </p>
        <p class = "section-body"> Fun Fridays have been adopted by all the teachers in the App Academy program, as well other teachers on campus. I have distributed a number of these self-made class games and ice breakers to other teachers.  
        </p>
        <p class = "section-body"> I have detailed a few of my favorite class games that I've designed myself! </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class = "section-body" style = "font-weight: 700; font-size: 18px;">Coding Survivor</p>
        <p class = "section-body">Based off of the popular show Survivor. students are divided into tribes of programming languages. Each student is allowed to pick a coding structure or library in their language. They can pick something as simple as loops or as complicated as the numpy library. There are allowed to be duplicates, although it is at their disadvantage. 
            <br>
            In each round, students participate in  a reward and immunity challenge. Reward challenges are fun and non-coding related - and the winning team might get candy, a clue to the hidden immunity idol, or an advantage. In immunity challenges, teams are giving a coding challenge - which they must complete using only the coding structures or libraries they have in their team. The team that loses the challenge must go to Tribal Council and vote one of their coding structures out. The voted out member becomes part of the jury. 
            <br><br>
            When half the members are voted out, the remaining players will merge. At the merge, the remaining players will draft the coding structures that were previously voted out of the game. Those will make up what each player will have moving forward into the individual portion. This forces the players to balance the team and individual portions of the game. If you vote out useful structures, the team portion is much more difficult, but if you make it to the merge, you will have better options for individual portion. 
            <br><br>
            During this merge, the jury works on coming up with a final coding challenge - trying to make it as tricky as possible. When three players remain, they will compete using the jury’s coding challenge. The winner earns 50 marbles for their class. 2nd place earns 20 and 3rd place earns 10. Everyone who makes the merge earns 1 marble each. 
            <br><br>
            When I get inspired, I will create advantages and hidden immunity idols that I hide around the classroom in the days leading up to the next round. The game is played over the course of a semester, usually running one round each week. </p><br>

            <p class = "section-body" style = "font-weight: 700; font-size: 18px;">Secret Grinch</p>

           <p class = "section-body">Based loosely on Mafia, Secret Grinch is a rendition of a lying-based coop game. In this game there are two teams - the villains and the heroes. The villains are made up of the Grinch and his dog Max. The heroes are Who characters. 
                <br><br>
                The goal of the heroes is to award everyone a gift. The goal of the villains is to have everyone on their team receive a gift and vote the Grinch as Santa Claus.
                <br><br>
                In each round, someone is nominated and voted as Santa. Santa picks up two cards from the deck. The deck is made up of cards face down, each of which have either a present or a piece of coal. Sometimes you might get two presents, two pieces of coal, or one of each. Santa must then discard one without showing the group and give the other to one of the other players. 
                <br><br>
                If a player receives a piece of coal, it eliminates any gifts they might have at that point. If they receive three pieces of coal, they are voted out of the game. The Whos must gift everyone still in the game a present OR vote the Grinch out to win. The Grinch and Max must have a present and the Grinch must be voted in as Santa to win. 
                <br><br>
                I have desinged multiple renditions such as Secret Voldemort: Death Eaters vs. Dumbledore’s Army and Secret Leperchaun: Leperchauns vs. Kingergartners. It’s a fun game of strategy, deceit, and trust! Many classes around campus have used this game as a fun icebreaker activity! </p><br> 
   
        <p class = "section-body" style = "font-weight: 700; font-size: 18px;">Escape Rooms</p>
        <p class = "section-body">I've designed a number of both in person and virtual escape rooms.

    <p class = "section-title"> But what I am most proud of...</p>
    <p class = "section-body"> is the community and relationships I have built here. </p>
    <p class = "section-body"> From this experience, I have learned the value of truly enjoying what you do, of finding meaning and ways to have fun in even the most technical settings. That perspective has allowed me to build and teach some cool projects, but more importantly. create meaningful relationships with my students. I feel very lucky to be teaching such kind and capable young adults. 
        <br> <br>
        I've attached a few student quotes that made me feel very proud of the work I have done these past four years. These excerpts were pulled from student surveys and the letter of recommendation my students wrote for me for my graduate application to Georgia Tech. </p>
    <p class = "section-body" style = "font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;"> "I think something that's really important is your relationships with us. I feel as though having a good relationship or respect for your teacher causes you to do better in their class. Since we talk all the time, I really enjoy this class and I'm glad to have you as my teacher." </p>
    <p class = "section-body" style = "font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;"> "Thank you so much for teaching us truly, I know we can be a bit crazy but I know we all love you the same. I love coming to your class I feel like I am very comfortable here and it's nice to have a place of stability where I am able to learn and sometimes have a bit of fun." </p>
    <p class = "section-body" style = "font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;"> "The positive aspects of this class for me so far have been the ability to have the freedom to be creative with my code and learning new things as well. I think having that open place to ask questions has been working for me but also asking my peers when I'm stuck on a question. I think that your eso understanding towards us, but also just your openness makes me comfortable to learn in this environment." </p>
    <p class = "section-body" style = "font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;"> "Ms. Orret never fails to empower her students. Whether it's pushing them to add more features to their code, encouraging and lending a hand to those less versed in programming, or supporting female students through the 28% Women in STEM Newsletter, a club that she both started and advises, Ms. Orret is a powerhouse for change and personal development. She actively listens to her students' problems and stories and does her very best to provide solutions, comfort, and smiles. Unlike many teachers, Ms. Orret's teaching style is dynamic and engaging. She is always striving to teach in ways that work best for her students based on feedback collected from students. To have a teacher that cares so deeply about her curriculum and the unique needs of each of her classes is extremely meaningful and successfully produces more students who are able to be their best selves in the classroom."</p>
