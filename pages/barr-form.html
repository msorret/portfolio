        Building a form to streamline the process of entering data following

      <p class="section-title">The Problem</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        In 2021, Pasadena High School introduced the BARR program for 9th grade
        students. BARR - Building Assets, Reducing Risks - is a strengths-based
        model that provides more than 170 schools with a comprehensive approach
        to meeting the academic, social, and emotional needs of all students.
        <br /><br />
        Part of the requirements for the implementation of the program is weekly
        grade check ins for all students, to better identify which students need
        support before grades are posted for the semester. Teachers were
        assigned 15-20 students and asked to fill out a spreadsheet for each
        check in.
        <br /><br />
        The spreadsheet was difficult to manage and use - and many teachers
        found it too time consuming to input the data. These UI led to less than
        25% of BARR teachers completing the weekly check-ins over the course of
        the 2021-22 academic year.
        <br /><br />
        As one of the BARR teachers that shared the complaints, I offered to
        create a form that would streamline the process of inputting and
        analyzing the student data.

      After observing and timing 3 teachers on campus, I found that on average
      it took each teacher 5-6 minutes per student to pull up grades and input
      the data, using this spreadsheet. This did not include the time needed to
      talk to each student about their grades and concerns. At 15-20 students,
      this is an extra 75 - 100 minutes each week spent just inputting data.
      <br />
      <br />
      I also conducted an initial survey with the BARR teachers on campus. The
      main complaints were how difficult it was to find the student they needed,
      the use of dropdowns to input the grades, and having to manually create a
      new row for each check in instance.
    </p>

    <p class="section-body">
      The Barr Coordinator, who used this spreadsheet to identify students who
      needed extra support, also noted that it was visually unappealing and
      overwhelming when there were so many data entries.

      <br />
      <br />

      I also asked teachers what features were most important to them when
      thinking about the design & functionality of a BARR grade check form. The
      main concerns were being able to move through the form, find students, and
      input grades quickly.
    </p>

    <br /><br />

    <div class="section">
      <p class="section-title">Ideation</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        Based on the survey results, I knew that my main goal was reducing the
        amount of time needed to complete the form. I also knew that eventually
        the data had to be organized on the spreadsheet, as that was one of the
        deliverables the BARR coordinator had to submit to the overarching BARR
        program. So, when I broke it down, I just needed to design a better UI
        for the data entry. I could then send the data to the spreadsheet and
        automatically organize it. <br />
        <br />
        So how could I reduce the amount of time? One simple way I thought to do
        this is by reducing the amount of time needed to find the correct
        student. I thought, if I had the teachers fill out a form - where they
        could type in the name of the student and the form data directly - I
        then could write a script that would organize those entries
        alphabetically on the spreadsheet.
        <br />
        <br />
        After looking into a couple different options on how to send data from
        an web based form to a Google Sheets, I found the platform SheetDB.
        SheetDb allows users to create an API endpoint from a google sheet. I
        could then use this API to post, get, edit, and delete data from the
        google sheet directly in a JavaScript script.

      <div>
        <p class="sbs-right" style="width: 410px, padding">
          I built an initial form with a simple design for teachers to try. Once
          the submit button was pushed, the script would create a new row on the
          google sheet with that data entry. A second function organized and
          color coded the google sheet by alphabetizing the student names.
          <br /><br />
          My initial design used some of the same features as the original
          spreadsheet - mostly for consistency and familiarity. With this first
          design, I wanted to see if taking away the step of finding the correct
          student would streamline this process enough to make a significant
          difference.
          <br /><br />
          After finishing the initial design, I observed the same three teachers
          as before using this new form. All three teachers were able to reduce
          the time it took for them to complete the form by a minimum of 30
          seconds. Success!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="section-body">
      I then pushed out the form to all the BARR teachers and conducted another
      survey to learn more about their thoughts and collect feedback on the
      design before moving into the next iteration.
    </p>

    <div class="side-by-side">
      <div class="sbs-container" style="width: 630px; height: 418px">

      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="sbs-right" style="width: 265px">
          Some teachers noted they liked how the student names pop up as they
          start to type in the name, making it easier and faster to find the
          student. <br /><br />
          A few teachers made some great suggestions to include descriptions of
          the Level of Concern and SMART goals - since not every teacher might
          know the acronyms. Another mentioned that it may make more sense to
          have Level of Concern listed after the grades.
          <br /><br />
          Verbally, one teacher I observed noted that the dropdowns for the
          grades made the form long and cumbersome and suggested using radio
          buttons instead. I ran that idea across a couple other teachers
          informally and they seemed to agree.

  <div class="section">
    <div class="side-by-side">
      <p class="sbs-right" style="width: 265px">
        In the final design, I took into account some of the teacher feedback to
        improve upon existing features, as well as add some new ones.
        <br /><br />
        Using a date API, I included an automatic date to keep track of when
        data entries were being made. I also added an entry for teacher name so
        that the BARR coordinator could keep track of who was completing the
        entries.
        <br /><br />
        I switched the grade entry from drop downs to radio buttons, which
        reduced the scrolling it required to access all the grades and
        streamlined the process of entering them. <br /><br />
        I added descriptions to the Level of Concern and SMART goal entries, as
        well as moved the placement of the Level of Concern entry to after the
        grade entries. <br />
        <br />
        Finally, once submitted the form automatically resets, but keeps the
        date and teacher name. This allows teachers to easily and quickly move
        on to the next student entry.

    <p class="section-body">
      The data from each entry was automatically pushed to the Google Sheet,
      adding a new row in chronological order.
    </p>

    <p class="section-body">
      Then, a separate script pulled that data into another sheet, organizing it
      alphabetically by student name and color coding grades and level of
      concern.
    </p>

    <p class="section-body">
      Teachers were given access to the alphabetized sheet, in order to see
      student progress - but not the actual sheet where the data was pushed to
      by the form. This allowed the BARR coordinator to keep a backup of all the
      data, just in case someone edited the data by accident.

      The BARR form was used to conduct grade check-ins throughout the 2022-2023
      academic year and is continued to be used during the 2023-2024 academic
      year. It was really rewarding to design and develop a solution for a
      problem that was so personal to myself and my coworkers. This year, I’ve
      conducted trainings with new BARR teachers and released video tutorials on
      how to use the form effectively - so it looks like this form is here to
      stay!
